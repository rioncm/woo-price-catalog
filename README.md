# Price Catalog

## Description

The Price Catalog plugin for WooCommerce allows you to manage and display customer-specific pricing for products. This plugin ensures that logged-in customers see their predetermined prices throughout the entire transaction process. If no specific price is set for a customer, the default site-wide pricing is applied. Prices can be set for individual products or variations and are managed via a REST API.

## Features

- Display customer-specific pricing on product pages and throughout the transaction.
- Default to site-wide pricing if no specific customer price is set.
- Manage prices for products and variations tied to WooCommerce product/variant IDs.
- REST API for CRUD operations and batch processing of customer-specific prices.
- Limited display and management in the WordPress interface.

## Installation

1. Download the code into zip file.
2. Upload the plugin zip file via the WordPress admin dashboard or extract it to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
